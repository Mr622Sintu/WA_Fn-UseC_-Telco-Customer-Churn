# WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn
# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom
 
 # Objective: Use a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will
 churn (leave the service) based on customer data.
 # Tools Required:  Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, numpy, scikit-learn)
 # Deliverables: Jupyter Notebook
# Hints / Mini Guide:
# Use LabelEncoder for binary categorical data (e.g., Yes/No).
 # Use OneHotEncoder for multi-class features (e.g., Contract type).
 # Scale features using StandardScaler() for models like Logistic Regression.
 # Visualize feature importance using .feature_importances_ from RandomForest.
# Save your model using joblib or pickle for deployment later
# Dataset names from Kaggle suitable for this Task:
 # Use “Telco customer churn dataset”
# By completing this task, you will: 
# Understand the full ML workflow from EDA to evaluation
 # Gain confidence in using scikit-learn’s ML tools
 # Build a presentable project for portfolio and GitHub
 # Learn to select and evaluate multiple models
 # Improve Python coding practices
 # Interview Questions Related To Above Task: 
# What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting?
# Why is feature scaling important?
# What evaluation metric would you choose for imbalanced data
 and why?
# How does a Random Forest work?
# What steps would you take if your model had low accuracy?
